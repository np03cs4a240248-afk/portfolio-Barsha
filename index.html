		<h2>My Projects</h2>
		<h3>Weather App</h3>
		<p>My weather web application is made by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP which
		fetches live weather data from the Open Weather Map API, stores it in a MySQL
		database and display weather information on web page based on the user's chosen or
		search for a specific city.
		I tried this during my First Semester, here in Herald College. </p>

		<h3>Banking System</h3>
		<p>This project is a Simple Banking System built using Java and GUI components (Swing). It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money between accounts. The interface displays all existing accounts along with their balances and provides input fields for each transaction type. It includes error handling for invalid inputs and ensures updates are reflected instantly in the output area. The system demonstrates fundamental concepts of OOP, event handling, and GUI design in Java.</p>
